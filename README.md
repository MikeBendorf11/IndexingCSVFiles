# C-Programming-Spreadsheet-Indexer
The program takes a text file in the CSV format and saves the information on a tridimensional array. Then the user can decide to search for specific keywords. Finally, the program will create and save the search results to the userRequest.dat file.

To run the program drag and drop any CSV file on the spreadsheet_indexer.exe file. A command prompt window will appear asking you to type the search criteria. You can try words such as Coco, Island or Islam. You can also search for currencies such as Dollar. You will be surprised by how many countries actually use this name or this currency. For displaying efficiency the search results are cropped to fit into the command prompt window. Eitherway after finishing your research, the complete results are displayed on the userRequest.dat file.

To quit simply press Control-C.
