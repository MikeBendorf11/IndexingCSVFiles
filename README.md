# Indexing CSV Files #

##### Process: ######

1. The program accepts a text file in the CSV format, takes the individual cell information and then puts it on a tridimensional array. 
2. The user can decide to search for specific keywords.
3. The program will create and save the search results to a tabulated userRequest.dat file.

##### How to: ######

Drag and drop any CSV file to the spreadsheet_indexer.exe file. An example file testLine.csv is included which contains the ISO list of country codes and a lot of other country facts. After dropping the file a command prompt window will appear asking you to type your search criteria. 
>For displaying efficiency the search results are cropped to fit into the command prompt window. After finishing your research, the complete results will be copied to the userRequest.dat file for your review.

While running the program you can try searching for words such as Coco, Island or Islam. You can also search for currencies such as Dollar or Pound. 

>You will be surprised by how many countries actually use these country names or currencies.

To quit the program simply press Control-C.
