# C-Programming-Spreadsheet-Indexer

To run the program drag and drop any CSV file on the spreadsheet_indexer.exe file. A command prompt windows will appear asking you to type the search criteria. You can try words such as Coco, Island or Islam. You can also search for currencies such as Dollar. You will be surprised by how many countries actually use this name or this currency. To quit the program simply press Control-C
